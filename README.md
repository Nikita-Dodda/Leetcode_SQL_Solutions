# Leetcode_SQL_Solutions


Here is my attempt on the leetcode databases problem set.
Each folder contains .txt files with problem statement and my solution at the end.

I gathered questions and answers from various sites and prepared a doc "Interview_prep_sql_theory". Hope this would help in your prep as well.
